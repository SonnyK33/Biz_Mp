"""model for how "bizmp" functions
1) sellers enter basic information about their business
    - sales
    - fixed and variable costs
    - how much of sales are recurring 
    - customer concentration 
2) a dashboard for the business is created that generates key metrics for valuation
3) buyers can use the dashboards to get a better sense of valuation 

e.g. 
A law office
- $300k annual revenue
    -30% sales ($90k = $1k x 90 deals)
    -70% purchases ($210k = $1.5k x 140 deals)
- $80k fixed costs
- $20k variable costs (230 deals ~$87 var costs/deal)
- of the 230 deals, 80% are from referrals, the rest are walk-ins
- of the 184 referrals, 10 realtors make up 70%
- owner is selling business for 2x sales 
    - will sell 1/3 each year for 3 years at 2x that year's annual sales
